## Data
This is where training data should be placed, including both the video files and the csv files created from `generator.py`. 

Make sure that the training video files are placed in the directory specified by the `CRASH_FOLDER` variable in `constants.py`. For example, if `CRASH_FOLDER = 'data/crash samples/'`, then place the training videos in the `data/crash samples/` directory.
